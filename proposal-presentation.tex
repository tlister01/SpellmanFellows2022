\begin{frame}{Research Question}
	\begin{block}{}
	Did the increased unemployment insurance (UI) benefits lead to a change in individuals' willingness to work, and what effect do the increased 	benefits have on creating a labor shortage in the United States?

\begin{frame}{Motivation}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Unemployment reached approximately 23 million at its peak
	\item Gov responded by passing C.A.R.E.S. Act
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Increased unemployment benefits
		\item Gave stimulus checks to millions of Americans
		\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Literature Review}
	\begin{block}{Baicker, Golden, and Katz (1998)}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Discussed the history of the United States Unemployment Insurance (UI) program
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Created by the \hyperlink{definitions}{\color{Gold}{omnibus}} Social Security Act of 1935
		\item Intended to provide UI benefits to individuals w/ attachement to labor force (i.e. temporarily unemployed)
		\item Three common features across U.S.
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item State System
			\item Potential for \hyperlink{definitions}{\color{Gold}{Experience Rating}}
			\item Limitation on Duration of Benefits
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Literature Review- Labor Search}
	\begin{block}{Mortenson (1977)}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Developed a more realistic model of job search
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Allowed workers to search while employed
			\item Search intensity is a choice variable
			\item Cost of search is viewed as the value of leisure given up
			\end{itemize}
		\item Common institutional features: 
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item Benefits are paid for a specified duration
			\item Workers that quit do not qualify for UI benefits
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{Conclusions}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Once features of most state UI programs are taken into account, UI benefits on measured search unemployment is theoretically ambiguous.
		\item Even though theoretical conclusion has not been tested, existing empirical evidence is consistent with it.
		\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Literature Review- Labor Search}
	\begin{block}{Katz and Meyer (1990)}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Looked at the importance of examining the layoff-rehire process in unemployment outcomes
		\item Found that \hyperlink{definitions}{\color{Gold}{recall}} expectations have a significant impact on individuals behavior while unemployed
		\item Found that \hyperlink{definitions}{\color{Gold}{reservation wage}} decreases and job search intenisity increased over time during unemployment
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{Why it matters?}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Gives an understanding of how workers \hyperlink{definitions}{\color{Gold}{recall}} expextations impact their behavior
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Literature Review- Supply and Demand (Kind of)}
	\begin{block}{Dube (2021)}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Looked at effects of \$600 UI boost.
		\item Used a difference-in-difference approach, compared change in \hyperlink{definitions}{\color{Gold}{replacement rate}} across different states
		\item Found 98 percentage point drop in the \hyperlink{definitions}{\color{Gold}{replacement rate}} on average.
		\item Found little impact on job gains as a result of a reduction in UI benefits
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{Why it matters?}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Does not directly look at labor supply and demand
		\item Does suggest, in this instance, that labor supply is not significantly impacted.
		%\item Does this have to do with workers' expectations on being recalled?
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Literature Review- Misc.}

	\begin{block}{Gruber (1994)}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Looks at changes in consumption behavior due to legislative variations in UI benefits
		\item Estimated that a 10 percentage point increase in \hyperlink{definitions}{\color{Gold}{replacement rate}} leads to a much smaller fall in consumption of 2.7\%%, when average decrease over this period was 7\%
		\item Suggests that decrease in consumption would have been three times larger without UI benefits.
		\end{itemize}
	\begin{block}{Remaining Questions}
	Does this mean UI benefits impacted consumption rather than labor supply and demand? Did it impact Both? To what degree?

\begin{frame}{Literature Review-Takeaways}
	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Worker expectations play a significant role in how they respond to unemployment spells. (Katz and Meyer 1990)
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Workers that expect to be \hyperlink{definitions}{\color{Gold}{recalled}} have a lower job search intensity
			\end{itemize}
		\item Labor supply is not greatly affected by changes in UI benefits (Dube 2021)
		\item Consumption is influenced by variations in UI benefits (Gruber 1994)
