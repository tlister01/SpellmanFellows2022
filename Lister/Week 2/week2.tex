	\begin{itemize}
	\item Provided quantitatve predictions of supply and demand shocks due to pandemic
	\item Measured occupations ability to work from home by creating a Remote Labor Index (RLI)
	\item Expected Results due to shocks:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Would threaten around 20\% of US GDP
		\item Would threaten 23\% of jobs
		\item Reduce total wage income by 16\%
		\end{itemize}
	\item Emphasizes that these results are only first-order shocks and they expect them to be amplified by feedback effects
